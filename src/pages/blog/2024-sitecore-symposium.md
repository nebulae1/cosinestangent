What hasn't already been said about Symposium? You might be asking yourself, wasn't that like 6 weeks ago? Why would I bother writing about a conference that is covered by Sitecore and many others before, during and after? Why? Because it was epic and the reverberations are being felt today in a big way. 

15 years ago I completed an international business program with the University of Cincinnati in Thailand. At the end, my professor PK said something that has stuck with me since then. He said you never know the impact of a particular program as it continues long after it is over. Which makes this blog even more valid. This Symposium was a multibeast, in a labrynth, that I sleighed.

## My Journey to Symposium
I have tried to attend Symposium in-person for the past 7 years or so. Ever since I knew it was a thing, co-workers coming back after the company paid for them to learn, make friends and have a blast! Unfortunately, I was a contractor and the company would always make it seem like I could go until the last minute and than I couldn't. This changed when I joined Sitecore as an employee and covid hit, bringing the virtual-only Symposium. Once again I was robbed of the experience.

This one I was determined, no matter what, to be there. So with that determination and encouragement from friends that were going to be there, I planed a cross-country road trip from Vermont, to Cincinnati, to Nashville, to Memphis, to St. James Missouri, back to Cincinnati and finally home sweet home. Why would I do all that when Symposium was only in Nashville? I was also determined to visit as much of my family as I could as I felt big changes were coming.

## Symposium Greatest Hits
These have been written about in detail, I will keep this short and sweet. I caught every Keynote and was blown away by Equalman, started watching Ted Lasso with my son, who scored his first football gooooooooaaaaaaal that weekend, after watching Brendan Hunt and becoming an honerary Diamond Dog (owww owwwoow owowooow). Last year I mentioned to my team that something like Sitecore Stream would really put Sitecore over the top, well they are leveraging it in all products, including XP! Last but not least is Dave O'Flanagan's rock star presence and inspirational capabilities.

## Symposium Technology
Sitecore had an app for the conference that just worked. It gave you reminders for what was about to happen, helped plan your schedule before you got there, and helped connect with people in ways I didn't know where possible by being able to book sessions directly with other attendees. Great job on this Sitecore!

## Accenture and Avanade
The main reason I was there. Everyone knows this has been a tough year for IT professionals and teams that put together these mega ecommerce platforms. When I found an opportunity for Avanade in Singapore I was intregued but didn't think I would be eligible living in Vermont, about as far away from Singapore as I could imagine. I was shocked when about 2 weeks later HR reached out to me about the same opportunity! A great friend and previous (and now current!) coworker, Scott Young, introduced me to all the right people, some I already had known. After spending the week with both teams, I knew I would not just fit in, but that I would thrive.

## Finally Offer Time!
I will always remember that moment. Midnight. At the bar. With Scott and my new friends. I thought I would take a moment to check emails. Yes, I am pretty much always working, even when I am having fun. There it was only a couple emails down, LIKE ROY KENT I SCORED MY OWN GOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAL. It was magical. It couldn't have been with better people. All while drinking "Rootbeer floats" at a college dive bar. Yes, they were delicious and everyone was drinking them.

## Swag
I definately got lots of great swag, which is one of my favorite things. The best though was Avanade, Sitecore and Microsoft's use of AI to generate images (and post cards!) of yourself as a country music star!! I sent those postcards to my biggest fans.

## Party Time!
Then began the real party. Sitecore knows how to throw a party. Everthing was meticulously planned and the level of detail was through the roof. If you know me, you know I have a sweet tooth and an eye for detail. Custom Sitecore logo topped cotton candy? Yes please! We all burned down the town and closed out Kid Rock's bar.

## Post Symposium
From there on, everything had a different meaning. Will the be the last time I see my grandmother? How do I handle that? What are all the things that I need to do before I leave and not be able to be with my family for 7 or so months? How do I thank the people who have went above and beyond to help shape my life? Can I really make this work?

## Singapore Avanade
So today was my first day at work. In a country I have never been, but everyone knew who I was. I got some cool swag. Time to thank 2 people who went above and beyond for me this past year, they get cards and care packages. Sounds corny right? But who sends people cards from around the world? I do. Those cards below represent some of my favorite things.. architecture, stained glass, fibbonacci and friendship. I love architecture, I wish I could build buildings like Frank Lloyd Wright instead I have to settle with software and digital infrastructures. I love stained glass, those cards have works of stained glass by FLW that I have selected specifically for that person. You find fibbonacci or the golden ration in all great works of art and everywhere in nature. FLW used it in his buildings and I see it in those cards. I actually used Blackwing fibbonacci pencils to write the cards. Yes, I know, I'm a nerd... at least I have friends. So friends, until next time, CHEERS!
