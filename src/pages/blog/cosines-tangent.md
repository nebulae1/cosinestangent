Well, it's official! COSINE'S TANGENT IS ALIVE!!! Now, I have a blog to write about things that interest me. I just built this thing so please poke around some and let me know what you think. Of course, there is not much here right now since I just launched it today. I hope to post often with topics ranging from tech and traveling; to good food and enjoying life with family and friends. 

I never had one of these before and it still smells new and a little funny. First time working with the AstroJS framework also and I have to say I kind of like it! This is a celbration post, so I will keep it short and sweet. I will have Part 2 where I go into building it and what issues I ran into. Until then, I will just work on this a little bit more X)
